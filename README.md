# Emptydrops_SoupX
Cell calling and background correction on individual single-cell experiments

This is the code used to call cells from the raw gene by barcode matrices returned by CellRanger and to run subsequent background correction. Cell calling was performed using the emptydrops function from the DropletUtils R package, and background correction was performed using the SoupX R package.
